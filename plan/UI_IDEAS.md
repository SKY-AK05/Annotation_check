## 1. Big Picture: From a "Tool" to a "Guided Workflow"

The current UI presents everything on one screen, which is functional but can be overwhelming. Let's transform it into a clear, step-by-step process that guides the user from start to finish.

-   **Guided Stepper Layout:** Instead of one long page, let's use a vertical stepper or distinct, numbered `Card` components for each phase of the process:
    1.  **Step 1: Upload Files:** This card is always active.
    2.  **Step 2: Configure Rules:** This card *unlocks* and becomes interactive only after a valid GT file is uploaded.
    3.  **Step 3: Review Results:** This section is populated only after an evaluation is successfully run.

-   **Single Source of Action:** The main call-to-action button should change based on the current step. Instead of just "Run Evaluation," it could be "Generate Rules," then "Run Evaluation," guiding the user's focus.

-   **Stateful Sidebar (Future Concept):** Imagine a collapsible left sidebar that lists all uploaded files and current evaluation "jobs." This would allow users to queue multiple evaluations or switch between different result sets without losing context.

## 2. User Workflow Enhancements (For the Trainer)

The trainer's main goal is to get accurate results quickly. Let's reduce their cognitive load.

-   **Smarter Form Interactions:**
    -   **Disable Dependent Inputs:** The "Student Annotations" and "Original Images" file inputs should be **disabled** with a tooltip that says *"Please upload a Ground Truth file first"* until the GT file is loaded. This prevents out-of-order operations.
    -   **File Validation Feedback:** When a file is uploaded, show a small green checkmark and the filename next to the input to confirm it was processed, rather than just relying on the rules appearing.

-   **Better Progress Indicators:**
    -   During rule generation, instead of just a generic spinner, show a message like *"AI is analyzing your schema..."*
    -   During evaluation, the progress bar is good. Let's enhance it by showing which student file is currently being processed: *"Evaluating file 3 of 10: `student_jane_doe.zip`"*

-   **AI-Assisted Workflow:**
    -   **Smart Format Detection:** The AI could analyze the GT file content and pre-select the "Annotation Format" for the user (e.g., auto-detecting if it's CVAT XML or COCO JSON).
    -   **Proactive Feedback:** If a user uploads a student file that seems to have a completely different structure from the GT, the UI could show a warning: *"This file seems to have a different format. Are you sure it's correct?"*

## 3. Accessibility Improvements

Making the tool accessible makes it better for everyone.

-   **Improve Color Contrast:** The `muted-foreground` color on `muted` backgrounds has low contrast. We can tweak the HSL values in `globals.css` to darken the text slightly, making it more readable without changing the overall feel.
-   **Full Keyboard Navigation:**
    -   Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, accordion triggers, table rows) are reachable and operable via the `Tab` and `Enter`/`Space` keys.
    -   Add `focus-visible` ring styles (using Tailwind's `focus-visible:ring-2` utility) to make it clear which element is active.
-   **ARIA for Dynamic Content:**
    -   When the results dashboard populates after an evaluation, the container should have an `aria-live="polite"` attribute. This will make screen readers announce "Evaluation complete, results are now available," which is crucial for non-sighted users.

## 4. Component-Level Refinements

Small tweaks to components can have a big impact on usability.

-   **Interactive Legend in `AnnotationViewer`:**
    -   The legend for "Matched," "Missed," and "Extra" annotations should be clickable. Clicking "Missed" should toggle the visibility of all missed annotations on the canvas, allowing a trainer to isolate and focus on specific types of errors.

-   **Nested Accordions in `ResultsDashboard`:**
    -   To handle large batches, the results should use a two-level accordion system. The top-level accordion is for each **student**. Opening it reveals their overall stats. Inside, a nested accordion would contain the breakdown for **each image**, preventing the page from becoming overwhelmingly long.

-   **Clearer Table Rows:**
    -   In the results tables, add a colored-dot indicator to each row that corresponds to the annotation type (e.g., green for matched, red for missed, orange for extra). This creates a stronger visual link between the table data and the viewer.

## 5. Future Concepts & "Blue Sky" Ideas

Where could we take the UI next?

-   **First-Class Dark Mode:** The `globals.css` file is already set up for it. We should fully implement and test a polished dark mode to reduce eye strain during long review sessions.

-   **Inline Annotation Correction:** This is the killer feature. Instead of just viewing a bad annotation, what if the trainer could **correct it directly in the `AnnotationViewer`**?
    -   A "Correct this Annotation" button could enable a simple drawing mode.
    -   The trainer drags the handles of the bounding box to fix it.
    -   Upon saving, the student's score for that annotation would be instantly recalculated to 100, and the change would be logged as a trainer override. This creates an incredibly powerful human-in-the-loop feedback system.

-   **AI-Powered Feedback Summaries:** For a batch of 50 students, a trainer doesn't want to read every line. A new Genkit flow could be triggered after the batch is complete:
    -   **Input:** All `EvaluationResult` objects.
    -   **AI Task:** "Summarize the most common errors across all students."
    -   **Output:** A summary card that says something like: *"Overall, the batch struggled with labeling 'occluded' pedestrians. 75% of students missed this attribute. Consider clarifying this in your next training session."*

-   **Gamification & Leaderboards:** For training environments, an optional leaderboard page could show student rankings based on their scores, fostering friendly competition and engagement. Scores could be anonymized with generated handles for privacy.
