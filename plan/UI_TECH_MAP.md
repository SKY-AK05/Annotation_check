## 1. Component Map

The application's UI is primarily driven by a main page component (`page.tsx`) that conditionally renders different views based on the selected `evaluationMode`. The core complexity lies within the Bounding Box evaluation workflow, which is managed by the `ResultsDashboard` component.

### 1.1 Component Hierarchy (Mindmap)

    ResultsDashboard (for Bounding Box)
      EvaluationForm
      RuleConfiguration
      (Conditional Results Display)
        SingleResultDisplay
          ScoreCard
          AnnotationViewer

            ::icon(settings) Controls
          FeedbackPanel

### 1.2 Data & Prop Flow

-   **Source of Truth:** The `page.tsx` component is the single source of truth for all application state. It holds file contents, evaluation results, UI state, and more.
-   **Prop Drilling:** State is passed down from `page.tsx` through multiple levels of components. For example, `results` and `onScoreOverride` are passed from `page.tsx` -> `ResultsDashboard.tsx` -> `ResultsDisplay` -> `SingleResultDisplay` -> `ImageResultDisplay` -> `EditableScoreCell`. This is a classic example of prop drilling.
-   **Callbacks:** Child components communicate upwards using callback functions passed as props (e.g., `onEvaluate`, `onRuleChange`, `onAnnotationSelect`).

## 2. State Management

The application exclusively uses the built-in React `useState` hook for state management.

-   **Centralized State:** All major state variables are declared in `page.tsx`:
    -   `isLoading`, `isGeneratingRules`: Handles loading states for different async operations.
    -   `results`: Stores the final evaluation results array.
    -   `evalSchema`: Holds the AI-generated rules.
    -   `gtFileContent`, `imageUrls`: Store the raw data from uploaded files.
    -   `selectedAnnotation`, `feedback`: Manage the interactive state of the annotation viewer.
    -   `scoreOverrides`: Manages user-edited scores, with `localStorage` for persistence.

-   **Inefficiencies & Bottlenecks:**
    -   **Monolithic State:** `page.tsx` is a "god component" that knows about and manages everything. This makes it brittle and hard to maintain. A change in one part of the state logic can easily impact unrelated parts of the UI.
    -   **Unnecessary Re-renders:** A change to any state variable in `page.tsx` will trigger a re-render of the entire component tree, including children that may not depend on that specific piece of state. For example, updating the `selectedAnnotation` will cause `EvaluationForm` to re-render, even though it has no dependency on the selection.
    -   **Lack of Encapsulation:** Logic is tightly coupled to the component. For example, the `localStorage` logic for `scoreOverrides` is mixed in with file handling and evaluation logic inside `page.tsx`.

## 3. Styling

The application uses a consistent and well-defined styling approach based on **ShadCN UI** and **Tailwind CSS**.

-   **Theme System:** The theme is defined in `src/app/globals.css` using HSL CSS variables for `light` and `dark` modes. This allows for easy and consistent theming of all components.
-   **Custom Fonts:** The project uses custom fonts (`Bangers` for headlines, `Karla` for body text) configured in `src/app/layout.tsx` and `tailwind.config.ts`.
-   **Component Styling:**
    -   **ShadCN Components:** The UI is built using pre-styled components from the `src/components/ui` directory (e.g., `Card`, `Button`, `Table`).
    -   **Custom Styles:** A distinct visual identity is achieved via custom utility classes like `shadow-hard` and `card-style`, which are defined in `globals.css` and applied throughout the application.
    -   **Utility-First:** Tailwind CSS is used for layout, spacing, and other fine-grained styling, adhering to a utility-first methodology.

-   **Inconsistencies:** The styling is remarkably consistent across the application. No major inconsistencies or redundancies were identified.

## 4. Technical Bottlenecks

### 4.1 Performance

-   **State-Driven Re-renders:** The primary performance bottleneck is the over-rendering caused by the centralized `useState` implementation in `page.tsx`. While not critical for this application's current size, this pattern would scale poorly and lead to sluggishness in a more complex app.
-   **DOM Parsing on Main Thread:** The `parseCvatXml` function uses `DOMParser`, which is a synchronous, blocking operation. While fast for small files, parsing very large XML files on the main thread could lead to minor UI stutters. This was largely mitigated by moving evaluations to a worker, but initial GT file parsing for rule generation still runs on the main thread.

### 4.2 Code Patterns

-   **Prop Drilling:** As mentioned, the deep nesting of props and callbacks makes the code harder to trace and refactor.
-   **Lack of Abstraction:** The logic within `page.tsx` for file handling, state updates, and worker communication could be abstracted into custom hooks (e.g., `useEvaluation`, `useFileHandler`) to clean up the component and improve reusability and testability. This is also highlighted in the `bottleneck.md` review.

## 5. Summary

The UI of Annotator AI is built on a solid foundation of **ShadCN UI** and **Tailwind CSS**, giving it a professional and consistent look and feel. The component structure is logical, but the application's architecture suffers from a highly centralized state management pattern in `page.tsx`.

**Key Strengths:**
-   Consistent and attractive visual theme.
-   Well-organized and reusable UI components via ShadCN.
-   Clear separation of concerns at the component level (e.g., `EvaluationForm`, `RuleConfiguration`).

**Primary Weaknesses:**
-   **Monolithic State Management:** Over-reliance on `useState` in the top-level component creates tight coupling and performance risks.
-   **Prop Drilling:** Deeply passing state and callbacks makes the codebase difficult to scale and maintain.

The most impactful technical improvement would be to **refactor the state management logic** in `page.tsx` into custom React hooks to better separate concerns and optimize rendering.
