## 2. The Complete Feedback Workflow & Stages

The feedback process is divided into two primary phases: **Automated Evaluation** and **On-Demand AI-Powered Feedback**. This hybrid approach ensures that users receive instant, objective scores while also having access to deeper, contextual insights when needed.

### Phase 1: Automated Evaluation

This phase occurs immediately after the user uploads the necessary files and clicks "Run Evaluation." All calculations are performed deterministically based on the configured rules.

**Workflow Diagram:**
```
+--------------------------+      +---------------------------+      +--------------------------+
| 1. User Uploads Files    |----->| 2. Data Parsing &         |----->| 3. Core Evaluation       |
| (GT, Student, Images)    |      |    Normalization          |      |    (evaluateAnnotations) |
+--------------------------+      +---------------------------+      +--------------------------+
                                                                                 |
                                                                                 v

| (Scores, Tables, Visuals)|      |    Generation             |      | (IoU, Accuracy, etc.)    |
+--------------------------+      +---------------------------+      +--------------------------+
```

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1.  **File Upload:** The user provides a Ground Truth (GT) file, one or more Student files, and any associated images.
2.  **Parsing and Normalization:** The system parses all annotation files (e.g., COCO JSON, CVAT XML) into a single, standardized internal format. This makes the evaluation engine format-agnostic.
3.  **Core Evaluation (`evaluateAnnotations`):** The system iterates through each student file and compares it against the GT data on a per-image basis. For each matched annotation pair, it calculates a series of metrics (detailed in Section 3).
4.  **Metric Aggregation:** The scores from all matched pairs are aggregated to compute averages for IoU, label accuracy, and attribute accuracy. The system also compiles lists of matched, missed, and extra annotations.
5.  **Score & Feedback Generation:** The aggregated metrics are fed into a weighted formula to produce a final score out of 100. A set of human-readable feedback messages is generated based on performance.
6.  **Results Dashboard:** The final score, feedback, and detailed breakdown tables are displayed to the user in the `ResultsDashboard`.

### Phase 2: On-Demand AI-Powered Feedback

This phase is triggered when a user wants deeper insight into a specific error.

1.  **User Interaction:** The user clicks on a specific matched annotation in the results table.
2.  **Data Preparation:** The system gathers the GT bounding box, the student's bounding box, and a Base64-encoded version of the image.
3.  **Rule-Based Pre-Check (`checkAllEdges`):** Before calling the AI, a fast, local function calculates the geometric status of each edge (top, bottom, left, right) as a "gap," "cut_off," or "aligned." This provides a provisional analysis.
4.  **AI Verification Flow:** The image data and the provisional analysis are sent to a Genkit flow powered by the Gemini API. The prompt asks the AI to act as an expert reviewer: visually verify the rule-based findings and generate a concise, helpful message. This two-stage process prevents the AI from hallucinating issues that aren't there and validates the geometric check against the actual image content.
5.  **Feedback Display:** The AI-generated feedback is displayed to the user, often with visual aids like highlighted overlays on the image viewer.

## 3. Core Evaluation Formulas and Metrics

The final score is a weighted average of four distinct metrics, providing a holistic view of annotation quality.

**Final Score = (Detection Score * 0.4) + (Localization Score * 0.3) + (Label Score * 0.2) + (Attribute Score * 0.1)**

### 3.1. Detection Score (40% Weight)

*   **Purpose:** Measures how well the student identified the correct number of objects. It penalizes both missed objects (false negatives) and extra, incorrect objects (false positives).
*   **Metric:** **F-Beta Score (with β = 0.5)**.
*   **Formula:**
    *   **Precision** = `True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)` = `Matched / Total Student Annotations`
    *   **Recall** = `True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)` = `Matched / Total GT Annotations`
    *   **F-Beta Formula**: `(1 + β²) * (Precision * Recall) / ((β² * Precision) + Recall)`
*   **Rationale:** We use a beta value of `0.5`, which weighs **precision more heavily than recall**. This choice intentionally penalizes the creation of "extra" (false positive) annotations more than "missing" (false negative) ones. It encourages annotators to be confident in their submissions and avoid speculative guessing.

### 3.2. Localization Score (30% Weight)

*   **Purpose:** Measures the pixel-perfect accuracy of bounding box placement for correctly identified objects.
*   **Metric:** **Average Intersection over Union (IoU)**.
*   **Formula:** IoU is calculated for every matched pair of annotations. The Localization Score is the simple average of all these IoU values, scaled to 100.
    *   `IoU = Area of Overlap / Area of Union`
*   **Example:** An IoU of `1.0` means the boxes overlap perfectly. An IoU of `0.5` means half of the total area covered by the two boxes is shared. The industry standard for a "good" match is typically an IoU >= `0.5`.

### 3.3. Label Score (20% Weight)

*   **Purpose:** Measures whether the student correctly classified the objects they identified.
*   **Metric:** **Simple Accuracy**.
*   **Formula:** `(Number of Correctly Labeled Matches / Total Number of Matched Annotations) * 100`
*   **Rationale:** This is a straightforward measure of classification correctness. It only considers annotations that were successfully matched, isolating the classification task from the detection and localization tasks.

### 3.4. Attribute Score (10% Weight)

*   **Purpose:** Measures the accuracy of supplemental textual or categorical data (e.g., "color: red", "license_plate: 'ABC-123'").
*   **Metric:** **Average String Similarity (Normalized Levenshtein Distance)**.
*   **Formula:** For each attribute defined in the evaluation schema, the system calculates the similarity between the GT and student text.
    *   **Levenshtein Distance:** Measures the number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into the other.
    *   **Similarity Score:** `1 - (Levenshtein Distance / Length of the Longer String)`
*   **Rationale:** Using Levenshtein distance provides a nuanced and fair text comparison that is robust to minor typos. For example, "licence" and "license" will have a high similarity score, whereas a simple equality check would fail completely. This provides a more realistic assessment of attribute accuracy.

## 4. Standardized Feedback Structure

Effective feedback is structured for clarity and actionability. Our system provides feedback at two levels: **Batch Summary** and **Detailed Annotation View**.

### 4.1. Batch Summary Structure

*   **Overall Score:** The final, single-number score (0-100).
*   **Key Metric Scores:** A breakdown of the four component scores (Detection, Localization, Label, Attribute).
*   **High-Level Feedback:** A list of 2-3 human-readable sentences summarizing the most important takeaways (e.g., "Excellent detection rate, but be mindful of bounding box tightness.").
*   **Critical Issues:** A separate, highlighted list of severe, systemic problems (e.g., "High number of missed annotations," "Low label accuracy for 'car' class.").

### 4.2. On-Demand AI Feedback Structure

When a user requests feedback on a specific annotation, the response follows a strict template:

*   **Annotation ID:** A unique identifier for the feedback request.
*   **List of Issues:** An array of identified problems. Each issue contains:
    *   `edge`: The side of the box with an error (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`).
    *   `status`: The type of error (`gap`, `cut_off`).
    *   `message`: A concise, AI-generated, human-readable explanation (e.g., "There's a small gap at the top; the box should be moved up to include the rest of the car's roof.").

This structured format allows the UI to consistently render feedback with appropriate visual aids (like colored overlays).

## 5. Strategies for Quality and Acceleration

Improving feedback is a balance between speed and depth. Here are strategies employed by the system and recommended for users:

### 5.1. System Strategies

*   **Two-Stage Verification:** The system's use of a fast, rule-based check followed by a targeted AI call is a deliberate strategy. It provides the speed of deterministic rules for 90% of the analysis and reserves the more expensive (but smarter) AI for verification and nuanced language generation, accelerating the overall process.
*   **Optimal Matching (Hungarian Algorithm):** By using a globally optimal matching algorithm instead of a simple greedy search, the system avoids cascading matching errors in dense scenes, which dramatically improves the quality and fairness of the core metrics.

### 5.2. User Strategies

*   **Use the `matchKey`:** If your dataset has a unique identifier for each object (e.g., a tracking ID), ensure it's configured in the `EvalSchema`. This is the fastest and most accurate way to match annotations, bypassing the need for computationally intensive IoU calculations.
*   **Review Batch Summaries First:** Before diving into individual errors, look at the aggregate scores and critical issues. If there's a systemic problem (like consistently mislabeling 'trucks' as 'cars'), addressing that high-level misunderstanding is more efficient than fixing one box at a time.
*   **Focus on High-Impact Errors:** Use the visual feedback to focus on annotations with significant `cut_off` or `gap` errors, as these have the largest impact on the Localization Score.

## 6. Real-World Scenario: Correcting a Bounding Box

**Scenario:** A student is annotating cars in a street scene. They draw a bounding box around a car but accidentally leave a small space between the top of the box and the car's roof.

1.  **Initial Evaluation:** The student runs the evaluation. The system reports a high Label Score (they correctly identified it as a "car") but a slightly lower Localization Score.
2.  **User Action:** The student clicks on the relevant row in the "Matched" table to investigate.
3.  **System Process (Internal):**
    *   The frontend prepares the GT box, student box, and image data.
    *   The `checkAllEdges` function runs locally, finding no issues on the left, right, or bottom, but identifies: `{ edge: "top", status: "gap" }`.
    *   This provisional finding is sent to the Gemini API with the image.
4.  **AI Verification:** The AI analyzes the image and the rule. It sees the car's roof is indeed not included in the student's box. It confirms the "gap" and generates a message.
5.  **Final Feedback:** The user sees the car on the screen. The area between the student's box and the car's roof is highlighted with a semi-transparent blue overlay. A message appears: *"There is a small gap at the top. The bounding box should be extended to include the car's roof."*

This process gives the user precise, visual, and actionable feedback, enabling them to quickly understand and fix their mistake.
